## 🎪 **DEMO SCENARIOS FOR JUDGES**

### **Quick Demo Path (5 minutes):**
1. **Start with Normal Weather** - observe baseline functionality
2. **Select Heat Wave scenario** - see emergency simulation
3. **Change user background to "Farmer"** - observe personalized advice
4. **Check extended forecast** - see 7-day predictions with confidence levels
5. **Switch to "Aviation" background** - compare different professional advice

### **Detailed Evaluation (15 minutes):**
1. **Test all 3 emergency scenarios** (Heat Wave, Storm, Flood)
2. **Try multiple user backgrounds** (Farmer, Construction, Aviation, Marine)
3. **Observe prediction consistency** - same conditions = same predictions
4. **Check extreme weather forecasting** - always shows at least one prediction
5. **Evaluate personalized advice quality** - profession-specific and practical

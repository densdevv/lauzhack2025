## Key Features
- Weather parameters (temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, etc.) predictions based on previous data
- Personalized safety measures based on user background selection in control panel
- Extreme weather simulations in control panel
- AI-powered weather anomaly detection for extreme weather forecast with 7-days.

## Important Remarks
- Please note that for demonstration purposes, changes in weather conditions are exaggerated.
- For more accurate predictions, the model has to be trained on more extensive data. The data used in this project is only symbolic and is generated quasi-randomly.
